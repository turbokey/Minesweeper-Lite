A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and long click again.
If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
Long clicking twice will give you a question mark symbol which can be useful if you are unsure about a square
Click the yellow happy face to start a new game.

Options and Enhancements:

Marks (?) - long clicking on a marked bomb will change the flag into a question mark. Long clicking again will hange it back into an unmarked square.
Area Open - If an open square has the correct number of marked neighboring bombs, click on the open square to open all remaining unopened neighbor squares all at once. 
If an incorrect number of neighbors are marked, or all neighbors are marked or open, clicking the square has no effect.
